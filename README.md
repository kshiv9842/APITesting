# ðŸ§ª curlParser â€” Automated API Testing from Raw cURL

**curlParser** is a developer-friendly tool that takes raw `curl` commands as input and automatically:
- Parses the command into method, URL, headers, and body
- Sends the request using an internal client
- Generates **negative test cases** automatically
- Validates **response structures against JSON Schemas**
- (Optionally) Validates **request payloads** before sending

> No more repetitive Postman clicks or fragile test scripts. Just paste your `curl`, and you're ready to test.
